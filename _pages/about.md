Hi there! I'm a final-year PhD candidate at Technical University of Munich ([TUM](https://www.tum.de/en)) and meanwhile research scientist at [Agile Robots SE](`https://www.agile-robots.com/en/). I'm advised by [Prof. Knoll Alois](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/people/prof-dr-ing-habil-alois-knoll`).

My research focuses on learning based robotic grasping and manipulation, LLM based task planning, sim2real, tactile sensors etc,.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
