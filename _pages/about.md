Hi there! I am a final-year PhD candidate at the Technical University of Munich ([TUM](https://www.tum.de/en)) and a research scientist at [Agile Robots SE](https://www.agile-robots.com/en). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Alois Knoll](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/people/prof-dr-ing-habil-alois-knoll).

My research focuses on learning-based robotic grasping and manipulation, large language model (LLM)-driven task planning, sim-to-real transfer, and tactile sensing, among other topics.
