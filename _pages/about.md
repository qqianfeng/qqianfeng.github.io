Hello, and welcome! I am a final-year PhD candidate at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/en) and a research scientist at [Agile Robots SE](https://www.agile-robots.com/en). I am fortunate to work under the guidance of [Prof. Alois Knoll](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/people/prof-dr-ing-habil-alois-knoll) at [Chair](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/air/home/) of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Real-time Systems.

My research centers on advancing the fields of learning-based robotic grasping and manipulation, generative models in robotics, synthetic data generation, imitation learning, and tactile sensing. At Agile Robots SE, I focus on bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world industrial applications, ensuring our innovations contribute to solving practical challenges.

I hold a Master’s degree in Robotics from TUM and a Bachelor’s degree in Mechatronics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). These experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in engineering and a passion for pushing the boundaries of robotics technology.
