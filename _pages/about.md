Hi there! I'm a final-year PhD candidate at Technical University of Munich ([TUM](https://www.tum.de/en)) and meanwhile research scientist at [Agile Robots SE](https://www.agile-robots.com/en/). I'm advised by [Prof. Knoll Alois](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/people/prof-dr-ing-habil-alois-knoll).

My research focuses on learning based robotic grasping and manipulation, LLM based task planning, sim2real, tactile sensors etc,.
